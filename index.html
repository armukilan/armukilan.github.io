        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I’m <strong>Mukilan</strong>, a Master’s graduate from the University of Dayton, where I conducted research in Multi-Robot Visibility-Based Pursuit–Evasion. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from SSN College of Engineering, Chennai.

          I am broadly interested in robotics, with previous work focusing on path planning, multi-robot systems, and related areas in robotic perception and control. I am always excited to explore new and challenging problems in robotics and intelligent systems.

          I have been fortunate to work with an amazing set of researchers and mentors. I am very grateful to have been advised by Dr. Nick Stiffler and to have had the opportunity to collaborate with many great people during my research journey.
